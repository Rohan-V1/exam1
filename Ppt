What is AI?
1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   AI is like teaching computers to think and act like humans.
   Just like how we use our brains to solve problems, learn new things, and make decisions, AI helps computers do similar things.
   -For example, chat gpt,robots etc...

How AI works?
Basically AI is completely depended on the Data.
For example chat gpt
ChatGPT is trained on a vast amount of text data from various sources such as books, articles, websites, and social media posts. This dataset covers a wide range of topics and writing styles to ensure the model learns to understand and generate text in a variety of contexts.

2. Machine Learning (ML)
   -Machine Learning is a way for computers to learn from examples and data, just like how we learn from experience.
    Instead of telling the computer exactly what to do,

How Machine learning works?
Machine Learning (ML) works by teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for each task
Example instagram ,
Instagram  uses machine learning algorithms to personalize the content shown in users' feeds based on their interests, preferences, and past interactions. These algorithms analyze factors such as the content of posts, user engagement, and relationships between users to recommend relevant photos and videos.

Will AI replace programmers?

AI is not likely to replace programmers entirely, but it is changing the nature of their work.Programmers who adapt to these changes and embrace AI as a tool to enhance their capabilities will remain valuable contributors to the software development process.

Conclusion 
AI and ML is just a programing concept and  it works as how we code  our thoghts  to computersied form . Basically it is a  technique used to  enhance the user interaction
